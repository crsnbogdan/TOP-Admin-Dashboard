TITLE: Admin Dashboard

VERSION NUMBER: 1.0

DESCRIPTION: This project is focused on using CSS grid to create an Admin dashboard. Being aquainted with flexbox , but not as much with grid I wanted to challenge myself and refrain from using flexbox as much as possible in this project. I also wanted to use TailwindCSS as it is a framework that looked promissing to me. Furthermore, I also tried using vanilla CSS as little as possible for the styling of elements to get more experience with Tailwind.
